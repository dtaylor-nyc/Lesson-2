	At The Space launch event last summer at the Tate Modern over 150 coders, hackers and digital artists were challenged to take any dataset and turn it into a work of art over the course of 24 hours.  With participants camped out overnight for the art hack, Tates cavernous Turbine Hall was transformed into a vast coders paradise, replete with the kind of creatively charged atmosphere that only a looming deadline can provide.  Backed by the likes of Sir Tim Berners Lee and the Oscar-winning visual effects teams behind both Gravity and Inception, the event also had the support of dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, who donated data that he and thousands of bloggers had collected for those at #HackTheSpace to use.  This data consisted of the names of over 5,000 children killed in the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake, information initially obscured by the Chinese government following a scandal over the inadequate construction of school buildings in the area something Ai Weiwei has been fighting to expose through his work.

	What was produced at the end of the 24 hours was as diverse as it was fascinating. The winning piece was an online interface that tracked server security attacks in real time. Each attempted breach originating from China triggered an audiovisual representation of one of the names. The effect was both disconcerting and strangely moving.

	Data as art is not new, but with the hack we wanted to show how it might become part of mainstream artistic discourse, as the boundaries between digital technology and traditional creative practice dissolve, and artists of all kinds come to see its potential for affecting and reflecting our world.

	No doubt this mirrors what is happening with the role big data is playing across industries and disciplines of all kinds, as its significance, value and practical applicability grows. Some projections point to the existence of up to 40 trillion gigabytes of data globally by 2020.

	One of the organizations putting the data revolution front and centre is the UKs Open Data Institute. Set up by Berners Lee and Sir Nigel Shadbolt (who was also at the hack), its role is to examine the broader economic, environmental and social value of data, and help inform public policy. Whats interesting for those in the arts is that the ODI is also running a Data as Culture program designed to interrogate datas cultural currency, which is essential.

	Its only through parallel creative exploration that the broader ramifications of open data can be clarified and communicated, both in terms of the value of the art itself and also what it can reveal about our increasingly complex lives.
